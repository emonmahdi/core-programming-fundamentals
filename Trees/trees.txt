1. What is a Tree?
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure used to represent relationships in a hierarchical manner.

2. Key Terminologies
Node: An element of a tree.
Root: The topmost node of a tree.
Parent: A node that has child nodes.
Child: A node that has a parent.
Sibling: Nodes that share the same parent.
Leaf Node: A node that has no children.
Depth: The level of a node in the tree (starting from 0 at the root).
Height: The longest path from a node to a leaf.
Subtree: A tree formed by any node and its descendants.
Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left subtree contains nodes smaller than the root, and the right subtree contains nodes greater than the root.

3. Types of Trees

A. General Tree
A tree where each node can have an unlimited number of children.

B. Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children.

C. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A special type of binary tree where:

    - Left child < Parent
    - Right child > Parent

D. Balanced Binary Search Tree
A BST where the height is minimized (e.g., AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree).

E. Heap (Min Heap & Max Heap)
A complete binary tree where:

    - Min Heap: Parent is smaller than children.
    - Max Heap: Parent is larger than children.

F. Trie (Prefix Tree)
A tree used for efficient search and storage of strings.

G. B-Trees
Used in databases for indexing.
