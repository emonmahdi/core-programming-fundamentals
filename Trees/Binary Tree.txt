1. What is a Binary Tree?

A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children:

    - Left Child
    - Right Child


2. Properties of a Binary Tree

    Each node has at most two children.
    The topmost node is called the root.
    Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.
    The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
    The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the deepest node.


3. Types of Binary Trees

✅ Full Binary Tree → Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
✅ Complete Binary Tree → All levels are completely filled except the last level (left-filled).
✅ Perfect Binary Tree → All internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
✅ Balanced Binary Tree → The height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1 (e.g., AVL Tree).
✅ Degenerate (Skewed) Tree → Every parent has only one child (like a linked list).




4. Creating a Binary Tree in JavaScript
// Define a node structure
class TreeNode {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

// Define a Binary Tree
class BinaryTree {
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }

    // Insert a new node (Level Order Insertion)
    insert(value) {
        const newNode = new TreeNode(value);
        if (!this.root) {
            this.root = newNode;
            return;
        }

        const queue = [this.root];
        while (queue.length) {
            let node = queue.shift();

            if (!node.left) {
                node.left = newNode;
                return;
            } else {
                queue.push(node.left);
            }

            if (!node.right) {
                node.right = newNode;
                return;
            } else {
                queue.push(node.right);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example Usage
const tree = new BinaryTree();
tree.insert(1);
tree.insert(2);
tree.insert(3);
tree.insert(4);
tree.insert(5);

console.log(tree);
