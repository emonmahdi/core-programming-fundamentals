A stack data structure follows the same principle and it’s called a LIFO data structure. LIFO means last in first out, the same way as a stack of dinner plates or other types of the stack in the real world works—the most recent element added to the stack should be the first out.

A stack data structure has two fundamental operations:

push—This operation is responsible for inserting or pushing a new element to the stack.
pop—This operation is responsible for removing the most recent element from the stack.
A stack is a linear data structure, which means that all elements are arranged in sequential order. It results that the push and pop operations can only happen at one end of the structure, in this case, the top of the stack.

The nice thing about working with stack data structures in JavaScript is that JavaScript already provides us the push and pop methods that we discussed. The push method adds an element to an array and the pop method removes the last element from an array.

We can start our stack by creating a new array named stack:

let stack = [];

Now we can create our push operation. This function will be responsible for receiving an element as an argument and adding this element to our stack.

const push = (item) => stack.push(item);

Now, we will create another operation called pop. This function will be responsible for removing the last element of the stack. Fundamentally it will be the last element added to the stack. Since we don’t know exactly which might be the last element of the stack, this function does not receive any argument.

const pop = () => stack.pop();



We can also implement a stack data structure in JavaScript using classes. Here’s how we can do it:

class Stack {
 constructor() {
   this.stack = [];
 }
 push(item) {
   this.stack.push(item);
 }
 pop() {
   this.stack.pop();
 }
}

Interview Questions and Answers
Stack Interview Questions

What is a stack?
----------------------
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element inserted is the first to be removed.


Where is the stack data structure used?
------------------------------
Function calls in recursion
Undo/Redo operations in text editors
Browser history (Back/Forward navigation)
Expression evaluation (postfix, prefix)
Backtracking problems (Maze solving, DFS)


How can you implement a stack using an array in JavaScript?
-----------------------------------------
Using push() for insertion and pop() for removal, as shown in the example above.


How can you implement a stack using a linked list?
-------------------------------------------
Instead of an array, you use a linked list where the top of the stack points to the last inserted node.


Time complexities of stack operations?
------------------------------------
push() → O(1)
pop() → O(1)
peek() → O(1)
isEmpty() → O(1)
