🔍 What is a Searching Algorithm?
A searching algorithm is used to find an element in a data structure like an array, list, or tree.

💡 Common Searching Algorithms
Linear Search

Binary Search


✅ 1. Linear Search
Concept:
Check each element in the array one by one until the target is found or the end is reached.

Use Case:

Useful when the array is unsorted

Searching for a product by name in a small list


✅ 2. Binary Search
Concept:
Divide and conquer. Only works on a sorted array. Compare the target with the middle value, and eliminate half of the array in each step.

Use Case:

Searching in large sorted datasets

Searching user names from a sorted list

Searching in a dictionary
