### **Hashing in Data Structure using JavaScript**
#### **What is Hashing?**
Hashing is a technique used in data structures to map data to a fixed-size value (hash code) using a hash function. It is primarily used for quick data retrieval. Hashing allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

A **hash function** takes an input (key) and converts it into a numeric hash code, which is then used to store the value in a **hash table**.

#### **Why Use Hashing?**
- **Fast Lookup:** Hashing provides constant time complexity O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations in ideal conditions.
- **Efficient Data Storage:** Used for quick data retrieval in large datasets.
- **Avoids Collision:** Good hash functions minimize the chances of two different keys getting the same hash code.
- **Security:** Hashing is used in cryptography to store passwords securely.

#### **Where to Use Hashing?**
- **Databases** (Indexing, caching, lookup tables)
- **Cryptography** (Password hashing, digital signatures)
- **File systems** (Detect duplicate files using hash values)
- **Networking** (Data integrity verification using hash functions)
- **Compilers and Interpreters** (Symbol tables for variables and function names)
- **Load Balancing** (Distributing workload using hash-based partitioning)

#### **How is Hashing Beneficial?**
- Reduces the time complexity of searching operations.
- Ensures data security using cryptographic hash functions.
- Optimizes memory usage in large-scale applications.
- Prevents duplicate records in databases.

### **Hashing Example in JavaScript (Implementing a Simple Hash Table)**
```javascript
class HashTable {
  constructor(size = 10) {
    this.table = new Array(size);
  }

  _hash(key) {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hash += key.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return hash % this.table.length;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const index = this._hash(key);
    if (!this.table[index]) {
      this.table[index] = [];
    }
    this.table[index].push([key, value]);
  }

  get(key) {
    const index = this._hash(key);
    if (this.table[index]) {
      for (let pair of this.table[index]) {
        if (pair[0] === key) {
          return pair[1];
        }
      }
    }
    return undefined;
  }

  remove(key) {
    const index = this._hash(key);
    if (this.table[index]) {
      this.table[index] = this.table[index].filter(pair => pair[0] !== key);
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
const ht = new HashTable();
ht.set("name", "Alice");
ht.set("age", 25);
console.log(ht.get("name")); // Output: Alice
console.log(ht.get("age"));  // Output: 25
ht.remove("age");
console.log(ht.get("age"));  // Output: undefined
```

### **Interview Questions and Answers on Hashing**

#### **1. What is hashing, and why is it important?**
👉 **Answer:**  
Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size value using a hash function. It allows fast retrieval of data, making search, insert, and delete operations efficient. It is widely used in hash tables, cryptography, and database indexing.

#### **2. What are some common applications of hashing?**
👉 **Answer:**  
- Implementing **hash tables** for quick lookups.
- **Cryptographic hashing** for password storage.
- **Database indexing** to speed up searches.
- **Caching** to store frequently used data.
- **Load balancing** to distribute network traffic.

#### **3. What is a hash function?**
👉 **Answer:**  
A hash function is a function that takes an input (key) and returns a fixed-size numeric value (hash code). It should be:
- **Deterministic** (Same input gives the same output)
- **Fast to compute**
- **Uniformly distributed** (Minimizes collisions)

#### **4. What is a collision in hashing, and how can it be handled?**
👉 **Answer:**  
A **collision** occurs when two different keys produce the same hash code.  
Collision handling techniques:
1. **Chaining** – Store multiple values at the same index using linked lists.
2. **Open Addressing** – Find the next available slot using methods like linear probing or quadratic probing.
3. **Double Hashing** – Use a second hash function to resolve collisions.

#### **5. What is the time complexity of hashing operations?**
👉 **Answer:**  
- **Best Case (No Collisions):** O(1)
- **Average Case:** O(1) (If hash function is well designed)
- **Worst Case (Many Collisions):** O(n) (In case of poor hash function)

#### **6. How does a hash table work in JavaScript?**
👉 **Answer:**  
A hash table in JavaScript is an array-based data structure that stores key-value pairs. The key is passed through a hash function, which determines the index in the array where the value is stored.

#### **7. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?**
👉 **Answer:**  
| Feature   | Hashing | Encryption |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Purpose | Fast lookup, indexing, security | Secure data transmission |
| Reversible? | No (one-way function) | Yes (can be decrypted) |
| Usage | Hash tables, password storage | Data protection, secure messaging |

#### **8. What are some commonly used hash functions?**
👉 **Answer:**  
- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**
- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)**
- **CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**
- **FNV-1 (Fowler-Noll-Vo Hash)**

#### **9. What is perfect hashing?**
👉 **Answer:**  
Perfect hashing is a hashing technique where there are **no collisions**, meaning each key is uniquely mapped to an index.

#### **10. What is the difference between a hash table and a map in JavaScript?**
👉 **Answer:**  
- **Hash Table:** A manually implemented key-value storage using an array and a hash function.
- **Map (ES6):** A built-in JavaScript object (`Map`) optimized for key-value storage with built-in methods for efficiency.

```javascript
const map = new Map();
map.set("name", "Alice");
console.log(map.get("name")); // Output: Alice
```

### **Conclusion**
- Hashing is a **powerful technique** for fast data retrieval.
- Used in databases, cryptography, caching, and networking.
- Interview questions focus on **hash functions, collisions, time complexity, and use cases**.
- JavaScript provides **Map** and **Set**, but custom hash tables can be implemented for learning and optimization.
