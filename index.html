        <h2>Searching Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Searching means locating a particular element in a collection of elements. The search result determines whether that particular element is present in the collection or not. If it is present, we can also find out the position of that element in the given collection.</p>

        <h3>Linear Search:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It is the most fundamental searching technique.</li>
            <li>Every element of the array is compared to the key element (the element that has to be found). If the element is found in the array then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.</li>
            <li>It is also referred to as sequential search.</li>
            <li>This technique is useful for a collection of items that are small in size and unordered.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Algorithm: </h3>
        <p>Note: let the element to be found is x</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start from the leftmost element of the array and one by one compare x with each element of the array.</li>
            <li>If x matches with an element return its index </li>
            <li>If x is not found in the array return -1.</li>

            
        </ol>
