### **Trie Data Structure in JavaScript (Simplified Explanation)**

A **Trie** (also called a prefix tree) is a special type of tree data structure used for efficiently storing and searching words, particularly useful for applications like autocomplete and spell checking.

---

### **How Does a Trie Work?**
1. Each node represents a character.
2. Words are stored by linking characters together.
3. The end of a word is marked to differentiate between complete words and prefixes.

---

### **Example of Trie in JavaScript**
Let's implement a **basic Trie** with three main functions:
- **insert(word)** → Adds a word to the Trie.
- **search(word)** → Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
- **startsWith(prefix)** → Checks if a prefix exists in the Trie.

```javascript
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = {}; // Stores characters
    this.isEndOfWord = false; // Marks end of a word
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  // Insert a word into the Trie
  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) {
        node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
      }
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true; // Marks the word end
  }

  // Search for a word in the Trie
  search(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) return false;
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    return node.isEndOfWord;
  }

  // Check if a prefix exists in the Trie
  startsWith(prefix) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let char of prefix) {
      if (!node.children[char]) return false;
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    return true;
  }
}

// Example Usage
const trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
console.log(trie.search("apple"));   // true
console.log(trie.search("app"));     // false (not a complete word)
console.log(trie.startsWith("app")); // true (prefix exists)
trie.insert("app");
console.log(trie.search("app"));     // true (now inserted)
```

### **Why Use a Trie?**
✅ Fast search and insertion (better than arrays for prefix-based lookups)  
✅ Useful for autocomplete and dictionary applications  
✅ Avoids duplicate storage of common prefixes

### **Top 20 Trie Interview Questions & Answers**  

### **Basic Questions**  

1. **What is a Trie data structure?**  
   - A Trie (or prefix tree) is a tree-based data structure that stores strings efficiently by breaking them into character nodes. It's widely used for autocomplete, spell checking, and dictionary applications.  

2. **Why is a Trie better than a HashMap for word search?**  
   - Unlike a HashMap, which searches in O(n) time for n words, a Trie searches in O(m) time, where m is the length of the word. Tries allow prefix-based searching efficiently, whereas HashMaps do not.  

3. **What are the main operations in a Trie?**  
   - The primary operations include:  
     - **Insert(word)**: Add a word to the Trie.  
     - **Search(word)**: Check if a word exists.  
     - **StartsWith(prefix)**: Check if any word starts with a given prefix.  

4. **What is the time complexity of Trie operations?**  
   - **Insertion, search, and prefix search:** O(m), where m is the length of the word.  
   - **Deletion:** O(m) (if implemented).  

5. **What are the advantages of a Trie?**  
   - ✅ Fast lookup for prefixes.  
   - ✅ Avoids duplicate storage of common prefixes.  
   - ✅ Faster than HashMaps for searching words.

### **Implementation-Based Questions**  

6. **How do you implement a Trie in JavaScript?**  
   - You can implement a Trie using a class-based approach with a `TrieNode` to store child nodes and a `Trie` class for operations (see the implementation example in the previous answer).  

7. **How do you insert a word into a Trie?**  
   - Traverse the Trie character by character and create nodes if they do not exist. Mark the last character as the end of the word.  

8. **How do you search for a word in a Trie?**  
   - Traverse the Trie along the given word’s characters. If you reach the last character and it’s marked as a complete word, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.  

9. **How do you check if a word starts with a prefix in a Trie?**  
   - Traverse the Trie up to the last character of the prefix. If the path exists, return `true`.  

10. **How do you delete a word from a Trie?**  
   - You traverse down the Trie, unmark the end of the word, and remove nodes that are no longer needed.  

---

### **Intermediate-Level Questions**  

11. **Can a Trie store numbers or only words?**  
   - A Trie can store any sequence of characters, including numbers, making it useful for storing phone numbers, URLs, and IP addresses.  

12. **How do you implement autocomplete using a Trie?**  
   - Traverse the Trie to the last node of the prefix, then use DFS or BFS to gather all words from that node.  

13. **How much space does a Trie use?**  
   - A Trie can take more space than a HashMap, especially when words do not share common prefixes. However, compression techniques like Ternary Search Trie or Suffix Tree can reduce space usage.  

14. **How do you optimize space usage in a Trie?**  
   - Using **Compressed Tries (Radix Trees)**, where nodes store entire substrings instead of single characters, reduces memory usage.  

15. **How do you find all words stored in a Trie?**  
   - Perform a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** from the root node and collect all words that reach an end-of-word marker.  

---

### **Advanced Questions**  

16. **How do you use a Trie for spell checking?**  
   - Insert all valid words into the Trie. To check spelling, search for the word and return suggestions based on similar prefixes.  

17. **How does a Trie compare to a suffix tree?**  
   - A Trie stores words from the start to the end, while a **suffix tree** stores all possible suffixes of words for efficient substring searching.  

18. **How do you find the longest prefix in a Trie?**  
   - Start from the root, traverse until a node has multiple branches or marks the end of a word, then return the accumulated prefix.  

19. **What are real-world applications of a Trie?**  
   - ✅ **Autocomplete (Google Search, IDEs)**  
   - ✅ **Spell Checkers (Microsoft Word, Grammarly)**  
   - ✅ **IP Routing (Networking, DNS lookups)**  
   - ✅ **DNA Sequencing (Bioinformatics)**  

20. **How do you implement wildcard searches in a Trie (e.g., ‘c*t’ should match ‘cat’ and ‘cut’)?**  
   - Use **Recursion or DFS**, where `*` can match any character and continue the search in all child nodes.
